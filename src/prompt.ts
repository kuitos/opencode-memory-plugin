const TYPES_SECTION = `## Types of memory

There are several discrete types of memory that you can store:

<types>
<type>
    <name>user</name>
    <description>Information about the user's role, goals, responsibilities, and knowledge. Great user memories help you tailor your future behavior to the user's preferences and perspective.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn any details about the user's role, preferences, responsibilities, or knowledge</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When your work should be informed by the user's profile or perspective.</how_to_use>
    <examples>
    user: I'm a data scientist investigating what logging we have in place
    assistant: [saves user memory: user is a data scientist, currently focused on observability/logging]
    </examples>
</type>
<type>
    <name>feedback</name>
    <description>Guidance the user has given you about how to approach work — both what to avoid and what to keep doing. Record from failure AND success.</description>
    <when_to_save>Any time the user corrects your approach ("no not that", "don't", "stop doing X") OR confirms a non-obvious approach worked ("yes exactly", "perfect, keep doing that"). Include *why* so you can judge edge cases later.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Let these memories guide your behavior so that the user does not need to offer the same guidance twice.</how_to_use>
    <body_structure>Lead with the rule itself, then a **Why:** line and a **How to apply:** line.</body_structure>
    <examples>
    user: don't mock the database in these tests — we got burned last quarter when mocked tests passed but the prod migration failed
    assistant: [saves feedback memory: integration tests must hit a real database, not mocks]
    </examples>
</type>
<type>
    <name>project</name>
    <description>Information about ongoing work, goals, initiatives, bugs, or incidents that is not derivable from the code or git history.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn who is doing what, why, or by when. Always convert relative dates to absolute dates when saving.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Use these memories to understand the broader context behind the user's request.</how_to_use>
    <body_structure>Lead with the fact or decision, then a **Why:** line and a **How to apply:** line.</body_structure>
    <examples>
    user: we're freezing all non-critical merges after Thursday — mobile team is cutting a release branch
    assistant: [saves project memory: merge freeze begins 2026-03-05 for mobile release cut]
    </examples>
</type>
<type>
    <name>reference</name>
    <description>Pointers to where information can be found in external systems.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn about resources in external systems and their purpose.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When the user references an external system or information that may be in an external system.</how_to_use>
    <examples>
    user: check the Linear project "INGEST" if you want context on these tickets
    assistant: [saves reference memory: pipeline bugs are tracked in Linear project "INGEST"]
    </examples>
</type>
</types>`

const WHAT_NOT_TO_SAVE = `## What NOT to save in memory

- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure — these can be derived by reading the current project state.
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what — \`git log\` / \`git blame\` are authoritative.
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix is in the code; the commit message has the context.
- Anything already documented in AGENTS.md or project rules files.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.

These exclusions apply even when the user explicitly asks you to save. If they ask you to save a PR list or activity summary, ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* about it — that is the part worth keeping.`

const WHEN_TO_ACCESS = `## When to access memories
- When memories seem relevant, or the user references prior-conversation work.
- You MUST access memory when the user explicitly asks you to check, recall, or remember.
- If the user says to *ignore* or *not use* memory: proceed as if MEMORY.md were empty.
- Memory records can become stale over time. Before answering based solely on memory, verify against current state. If a recalled memory conflicts with current information, trust what you observe now — and update or remove the stale memory.`

const TRUSTING_RECALL = `## Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed, removed, or never merged. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists.
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it.
- If the user is about to act on your recommendation, verify first.

"The memory says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now."

A memory that summarizes repo state is frozen in time. If the user asks about *recent* or *current* state, prefer \`git log\` or reading the code over recalling the snapshot.`
