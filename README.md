# opencode-memory

Cross-session memory plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — **fully compatible with Claude Code's memory format**.

Claude Code writes memories → OpenCode reads them.  
OpenCode writes memories → Claude Code reads them.

## Features

- **5 tools**: `memory_save`, `memory_delete`, `memory_list`, `memory_search`, `memory_read`
- **Claude Code compatible**: shares the same `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` directory
- **Auto-extraction**: shell wrapper that automatically extracts memories after each session
- **System prompt injection**: existing memories are injected into every conversation
- **4 memory types**: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference` (same taxonomy as Claude Code)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-memory-plugin
```

This does two things:

- Registers the **plugin** (memory tools + system prompt injection)
- Places an `opencode` **wrapper** in your global bin that auto-extracts memories after each session

> The wrapper is a drop-in replacement — it finds the real `opencode` binary in `PATH`, runs it normally, then triggers memory extraction in the background when you exit.

### 2. Configure the plugin

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-memory-plugin"]
}
```

### 3. Use

Just run `opencode` as usual. The memory tools are available to the AI agent:

- **"Remember that I prefer terse responses"** → saves a `feedback` memory
- **"What do you remember about me?"** → reads from memory
- **"Forget the memory about my role"** → deletes a memory

When you exit a session, memories are automatically extracted in the background.

### Uninstall

```bash
npm uninstall -g opencode-memory-plugin
```

This removes both the wrapper and the plugin. Your saved memories in `~/.claude/projects/` are **not** deleted.

## Auto-Extraction

The wrapper:

1. Finds the real `opencode` binary (skips itself in `PATH`)
2. Runs it normally with all your arguments
3. After you exit, finds the most recent session
4. Forks that session and sends a memory extraction prompt
5. The extraction runs **in the background** — you're never blocked

### How it works

```
You run `opencode`
  → wrapper finds real opencode binary (skipping itself in PATH)
  → runs real opencode with your arguments
  → you exit
  → opencode session list --format json -n 1  (get last session)
  → opencode run -s <id> --fork "<extraction prompt>"  (background)
  → memories saved to ~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_EXTRACT` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable auto-extraction |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_FOREGROUND` | `0` | Set to `1` to run extraction in foreground (debugging) |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_MODEL` | *(default)* | Override model for extraction (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_AGENT` | *(default)* | Override agent for extraction |

### Logs

Extraction logs are written to `$TMPDIR/opencode-memory-logs/extract-*.log`.

### Concurrency safety

A file lock prevents multiple extractions from running simultaneously on the same project. Stale locks (from crashed processes) are automatically cleaned up.

## Memory Format

Each memory is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: User prefers terse responses
description: User wants concise answers without trailing summaries
type: feedback
---

Skip post-action summaries. User reads diffs directly.

**Why:** User explicitly requested terse output style.
**How to apply:** Don't summarize changes at the end of responses.
```

### Memory types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `user` | User's role, expertise, preferences |
| `feedback` | Guidance on how to work (corrections and confirmations) |
| `project` | Ongoing work context not derivable from code |
| `reference` | Pointers to external resources |

### Index file

`MEMORY.md` is an index (not content storage). Each entry is one line:

```markdown
- [User prefers terse responses](feedback_terse_responses.md) — Skip summaries, user reads diffs
- [User is a data scientist](user_role.md) — Focus on observability/logging context
```

## Claude Code Compatibility

This plugin uses the **exact same path algorithm** as Claude Code:

1. Find the canonical git root (resolves worktrees to their main repo)
2. Sanitize the path with `sanitizePath()` (Claude Code's algorithm, including `djb2Hash` for long paths)
3. Store in `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized>/memory/`

This means:
- Git worktrees of the same repo share the same memory directory
- The sanitized path matches Claude Code's output exactly
- Memory files use the same frontmatter format and type taxonomy
