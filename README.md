## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-claude-memory
```

This installs:
- The **plugin** — memory tools + system prompt injection
- An `opencode` **wrapper** — auto-extracts memories after each session

### 2. Configure

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-claude-memory"]
}
```

### 3. Use

```bash
opencode  # just use it as usual
```

The AI agent can now use memory tools:

- **"Remember that I prefer terse responses"** → saves a `feedback` memory
- **"What do you remember about me?"** → reads from memory
- **"Forget the memory about my role"** → deletes a memory

When you exit, memories are extracted in the background — zero blocking.

<details>
<summary>🗑️ Uninstall</summary>

```bash
npm uninstall -g opencode-claude-memory
```

This removes the wrapper and the plugin. Your saved memories in `~/.claude/projects/` are **not** deleted.

</details>

## 💡 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[You run opencode] --> B[Wrapper finds real binary]
    B --> C[Runs opencode normally]
    C --> D[You exit]
    D --> E[Get latest session ID]
    E --> F[Fork session + extract memories]
    F --> G[Memories saved to ~/.claude/projects/]
```

The wrapper is a drop-in replacement that:

1. Scans `PATH` to find the real `opencode` binary (skipping itself)
2. Runs it with all your arguments
3. After you exit, forks the session with a memory extraction prompt
4. Extraction runs **in the background** — you're never blocked

### Claude Code Compatibility

This plugin uses the **exact same path algorithm** as Claude Code:

1. Find the canonical git root (resolves worktrees to their main repo)
2. Sanitize the path with `sanitizePath()` (Claude Code's algorithm, including `djb2Hash` for long paths)
3. Store in `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized>/memory/`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_EXTRACT` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable auto-extraction |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_FOREGROUND` | `0` | Set to `1` to run extraction in foreground (debugging) |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_MODEL` | *(default)* | Override model for extraction |
| `OPENCODE_MEMORY_AGENT` | *(default)* | Override agent for extraction |

### Logs

Extraction logs are written to `$TMPDIR/opencode-memory-logs/extract-*.log`.

### Concurrency Safety

A file lock prevents multiple extractions from running simultaneously on the same project. Stale locks (from crashed processes) are automatically cleaned up.

## 📝 Memory Format

Each memory is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: User prefers terse responses
description: User wants concise answers without trailing summaries
type: feedback
---

Skip post-action summaries. User reads diffs directly.

**Why:** User explicitly requested terse output style.
**How to apply:** Don't summarize changes at the end of responses.
```

### Memory Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `user` | User's role, expertise, preferences |
| `feedback` | Guidance on how to work (corrections and confirmations) |
| `project` | Ongoing work context not derivable from code |
| `reference` | Pointers to external resources |

<details>
<summary>📄 Index file (MEMORY.md)</summary>

`MEMORY.md` is an auto-managed index (not content storage). Each entry is one line:

```markdown
- [User prefers terse responses](feedback_terse_responses.md) — Skip summaries, user reads diffs
- [User is a data scientist](user_role.md) — Focus on observability/logging context
```

</details>
